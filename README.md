Week 12 Challenge Team Profile Generator
# Module 12 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

NOTES
The render function that is referred to in the instructions is page-template.js.

TO DO LIST
The instructions below say to call the render function and pass in an array containing all the employee objects, so maybe that is something like:
render(manager, engineer, intern) or
render(team) where team is the array that was empty?

Readme outline. Use last week's as it was probably your best.
Add screenshot with proper link.
Check submission requirements.

## Instructions

    * When a user decides to finish building their team then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
  * Call the `render` function (provided for you) and pass in an array containing all employee objects; 
    * The `render` function will generate and return a block of HTML including templated divs for each employee!
  * Create an HTML file using the HTML returned from the `render` function. 
    * Write it to a file named `team.html` in the `output` folder. 
    * You can use the provided variable `outputPath` to target this location.

## Hints  
* You may need to check if the `output` folder exists and create it if it does not.

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A sample HTML file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
